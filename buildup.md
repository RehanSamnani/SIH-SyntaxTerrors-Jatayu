Phase 2: Telemetry Aggregator & Local Messaging - Complete âœ…
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive telemetry aggregator service and local MQTT messaging system for your AI-enabled drone companion prototype.

Core Components Created
src/telemetry_service.py: The main telemetry aggregator service. It subscribes to GPS and IMU MQTT topics, aggregates sensor data into unified telemetry packets, and publishes to drone/<id>/telemetry every second. It also writes the last 500 packets to a rotating telemetry.log, includes a --dry-run mode for testing, and monitors battery and camera status.

scripts/setup_mqtt_broker.sh: A script that installs and configures the Mosquitto MQTT broker, with optional authentication and TLS encryption.

scripts/telemetry.service: A Systemd service unit for automatic startup on boot, with resource limits (256MB RAM, 50% CPU) and security hardening.

scripts/install_telemetry_service.sh: A service installation script that handles directory creation, log rotation, and provides management commands.

Testing & Monitoring Tools
scripts/test_telemetry.py: A comprehensive test suite that validates MQTT connectivity, tests the telemetry message format, and simulates sensor data publishing.

scripts/monitor_telemetry.py: A terminal-based dashboard for real-time telemetry display, data visualization, and status monitoring.

scripts/validate_phase2.py: An automated script to validate all Phase 2 components, check dependencies, and test service functionality.

Documentation
docs/phase2_telemetry.md: Complete technical documentation including an architecture overview, installation instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

docs/phase2_quickstart.md: A quick start guide with 5-minute setup instructions, expected outputs, and a validation checklist.

Key Features Implemented
Telemetry Aggregation: Merges GPS, IMU, battery, and camera data.

MQTT Publishing: Publishes data to a drone/<id>/telemetry topic every second.

Rotating Logs: Keeps the last 500 packets with size limits and automatic rotation.

Dry-Run Mode: Allows testing without physical sensors using simulated data.

Systemd Integration: A production-ready service with automatic startup and resource limits.

Comprehensive Testing: Automated validation and monitoring tools are included.

Security Hardening: Secure execution with non-root privileges and other security best practices.

Error Handling: Includes graceful shutdown and reconnection logic.

Ready for Testing
The system is now ready for immediate testing. You can run the following quick test from your shell:

Bash

# Quick 5-minute test
bash scripts/setup_mqtt_broker.sh
python src/telemetry_service.py --dry-run
python scripts/monitor_telemetry.py
Telemetry Message Format
The service produces compact, standardized JSON packets that include:

Device ID and timestamps

GPS coordinates and altitude

IMU angles and raw sensor data

Battery voltage and percentage

Camera status

Integration Ready
This system is designed for seamless integration with other components, including:

Phase 1: Existing GPS and IMU sensor readers

Phase 3: The vision system for obstacle detection

Phase 4: The mission runner for waypoint navigation

Phase 5: The Supabase backend for data synchronization

The modular, MQTT-based architecture ensures loose coupling between components while providing a reliable, real-time data flow for mission-critical operations.

Phase 2 is complete and ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
